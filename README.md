# android-debloatation & root
i have a slow redmi note 10 JE  phone, so let's make more fast !!, or less slow??
so this journey started when i tried playing PUBG:MOBILE in my new redmi note 10 JE , but guess what ,a potato with a screen do better than whatever this thing do,and this started my career in rooting and debloating phones using ADB and other tools ,i got the idea of tweaking and looking forward into phone opirationg system and softwares,and with the help of chatGPT i can get my feet on this field of tech and science.
phones i worked on so far:

- redmi note 10 JE: this phone have snapdragon 480 and 4+3 gigs of ram --> Android 10, upgradable to Android 13, MIUI 14
- samsung a51: this phone have Exynos 9611 and 6 gigs of ram -->	Android 10, upgradable to Android 13, One UI 5

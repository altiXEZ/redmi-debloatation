sooo...about that redmi...i had some problems like error 10004 bcz the device was not able to connect to MI-flash-tool
  it turned out that my phone model is XIG02,and that model is permenatly locked...so no matter what i do i can't root it
maybe i will debloat the systeme as much as possible by changing launchers and deleting stuff by ADB
